1) As API is not supporting multiple Price ranges, 
   filteres are designed to load products between min and max rates selected by user.
   For Instance, User selected "Below $25, $25 - $50 and $150 - $300", then system treats this range as "below $300"
2) Mocked Ratings. As Rating details are not provided by current API, I've randomly picked rates betwen 3and 5.
3) Product Category options (Tree View) are limited as API is returning 3 categories data only. "tools", "brushes", "markup"
